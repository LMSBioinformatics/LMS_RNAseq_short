1. a) Perform the Principal Component Analysis using rlog method and find out % significance values of first two principal components .


 b) Repeat the PCA, this time using VST method and compare the plots with the ones obtained using rlog method.
 
2. Perform sample clustering and compare it with the clusters obtained using PCA.

3. Draw MA plot and highlight all significant genes with adjusted p value less than 0.05.  

4. Draw a heatmap based on top 40 differentially expressed genes.

5. a) Use function plotCounts() to plot the counts for gene ENSMUSG00000024526. (b) Plot the unnormalized counts.
