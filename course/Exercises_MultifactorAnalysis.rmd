1.  Perform differential expression analysis incorporating batch as additional factor. 

a) Find the number of genes that are changed because of condition at FDR 0.05.

b) Find the number of genes that are changed because of batch at FDR 0.05.


2. Repeat above analysis sing likelihood ratio test instead of the wald test,

a) Find the number of genes that are changed because of condition at FDR 0.05.

b) Find the number of genes that are changed because of batch at FDR 0.05.
