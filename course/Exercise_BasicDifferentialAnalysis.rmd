In this exercise, we will read in a count data from erythroblast differentiation experiment in mice. This data was downloaded from GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49843) and aligned to mm9 genome assembly using  Rsubread R package. More details with regards to this experiment please refer to (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24092935). 

* Material

  Sample description: Exercise_ShortRNAseq_sample.info

  Count data: Exercise_ShortRNAseq_counts.csv


1. Read in sample information and count data.
   Identify how many factors are involved in this this experiment.


2. Construct DESeqDataSet object using sample information and counts data.


3. a) Find the number of genes that are changed in knockdown samples versus control, i.e. KOa vs FFa and KOb vs FFa, at FDR 0.05 irrespective of fold change.

 b) Find the number of genes that are changed in the above situation with fold change threshold, i.e. fold change ratio > 2.
 
 4. Using Biomart, add extra columns to the results dataframe such as gene name, gene biotype, gene description etc. 
 
 5. Draw MA plot and highlight all significant genes with adjusted p value less than 0.05.  

 6. a) Use function plotCounts() to plot the counts for gene ENSMUSG00000024526. (b) Plot the unnormalized counts.
